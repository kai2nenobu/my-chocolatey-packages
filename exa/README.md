# exa

[exa](https://the.exa.website/) is a modern replacement for _ls_.

![Screenshots of exa][exa_screenshots]

---

**exa** is a modern replacement for the venerable file-listing command-line program `ls` that ships with Unix and Linux operating systems, giving it more features and better defaults.
It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata.
It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git.
And it’s **small**, **fast**, and just **one single binary**.

By deliberately making some decisions differently, exa attempts to be a more featureful, more user-friendly version of `ls`.
For more information, see [exa’s website](https://the.exa.website/).
